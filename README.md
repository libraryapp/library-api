### This *should* get the app up and running:
---
 1. [Install Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) to compile and run the app
 2. Set up a database - [currently configured for MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/installing.html) but can be easily changed in configuration.yml
 3. Can use the eg_db.sql file to get the basic database structure and a couple of dummy entries.
 4. In the terminal, run ./gradlew build
 5. Then ./gradlew run

Until swagger gets involved, view all books at [localhost:8080/books](http://localhost:8080/books) and an individual book like [localhost:8080/books/1](http://localhost:8080/books/1)
